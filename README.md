## Ravelry Yarn Search API
This is a work in progress project.

The idea behind this project is to simplify the Ravelry Search for myself. I want to search yarns in a specific color, that are available near me; if possible, I also want to see the price range the yarn is sold in. I want to create lists/collections, for example a shopping list for a specific knitting project I am planning. I can create multiple lists for myself and save yarns to them. 



## Available Features (WIP)
- [x] Register and Login user via API (POST)
- [x] CRUD for collections
- [x] Ravelry API Service Setup
- [ ] Extract yarn data from Ravelry's yarn and stash resources
- [ ] CRUD for yarns
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Optimization: Better Filtering (DataFilterService)
- [ ] Feature: Show buying options near me



## Planned technical stack
Laravel REST API as backend, React as frontend. Redis for caching Ravelry API responses.
